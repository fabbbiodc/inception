# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
This repository is an infrastructure project for multi-service deployment using Docker Compose. It orchestrates several services (nginx, mariadb, wordpress, redis, ftp, portainer, adminer) with custom configurations and initialization scripts. The structure is designed for modularity and clear separation of service responsibilities.

## Architecture & Key Components
  - `Dockerfile`: Defines the build for the service container.
  - `conf/`: Configuration files (e.g., nginx, mariadb, redis, ftp, wordpress, adminer).
  - `tools/`: Initialization scripts (e.g., `*-init.sh`, `ssl.sh`).
